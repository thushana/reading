It's commonly accepted that government software is, on average, worse than tech sector software. This is part of why the US Digital Service exists - why would anyone be excited to recruit from the private sector if they didn't think it had something government lacked?

But why is government software worse? It's not because government employees are worse. The answers are found in the ways the government environment is different. Take one of these first order causes, ask why it exists, and you'll find another set of causes behind it. That's true in a lot of places - a hundred years ago Sakichi Toyoda recommended asking "5 Whys" to get to the true sources of a problem. When problems are multicausal and each why yields multiple answers, your answers build up into a tree instead of a line.

Three years in government has given me a lot of time to think on this. Here are my best answers down a single branch, which I hope can give those not in government (or new to it) a better perspective.  I hope this list helps answer the larger question - why known problems, worked on by smart people before we ever arrived, can be so resistant to solutions.

+ Why is government software worse than industry?
  + Much of it was written decades ago when technology was less advanced. (Why? We rarely replace old systems.)
  + Software doesn’t get improved after launch, because it immediately goes into a maintenance mode with few or no developers. (Why? The policy modeled industry practice in the 80s and haven't changed. Hard to justify and verify the value of refactoring to nontechnical audiences.)
  + It’s hard to justify improving the experience. (Why? There’s no competition and it’s a higher bar to expend taxpayer money.)
  + It’s hard to get funding even when justified. (Why? Your budget is generally decided once a year and requires an act of Congress.)
  + Most of all, government software is worse because government is worse at making software.

+ Why is government worse at making software?
  + Outdated software development processes like waterfall and ITIL. (Why? False sense of security - all costs and estimates are upfront, changes go through many points of control.)
  + Technical work done through contracted labor is restricted in ways full-time employees are not. (Why? Minor work not specified in the contract requires a contract modification, major work requires a recompete.)
  + Organizational silos prevent individual teams from making independent progress. (Why? Cultural preference for external checks and controls over efficiency. Empowering development teams requires technical infrastructure not common in government.)
  + Little reward for cost savings. (Why? Unspent money is returned at the end of the financial year. Offices that underspend budget one year are targets for cuts next year.)
  + Oversight rewards staff for having a policy and complying with it, not for efficiency. (Why? Oversight wants to safeguard taxpayer money.  It's easy for oversight to punish misuse of taxpayer money or deviation from policy, hard to punish inefficiency in policy itself.)
  + Most of all, the process is worse because it’s hard to make improvements to the process itself.

+ Why is it hard to change how government makes software?
  + Policies are rigid, overlapping, and have many different sources. (Why? Acts of Congress, OMB regulations and guidance, then department regulations and guidance, finally office regulations and guidance.)
  + Understanding of policies is imprecise and has a lot of myths or tribal knowledge. (Why? Employees rightly prioritize mission work over closely reading the hundreds of potentially applicable policy memos. Summarizing and deconflicting policies is difficult. No responsibility for most policy issuers to ensure knowledge of new policies or the revocation of old policies.)
  + New companies are a source of radical change in industry, but new bureaus are rare. (Why? Requires an Act of Congress. Running a new and old bureau simultaneously in competition requires a market.)
  + Permissibility of new changes is unclear. (Why? Lot of regulations to consider. Final legal decision is by the judicial branch, which cannot be consulted in advance.)
  + Most of all, it’s hard to make changes because most bureaus don’t agree internally on how to improve software development.

+ Why don’t bureaus agree on how to improve software development?
  + Chief Information Officers often have backgrounds in administration and accounting - meaning their staff needs to set direction on development. (Why? Those are the skills for a CIO’s primary job - managing the cost of the large contracts that support infrastructure and back-office IT.)
  + Technical work is largely done by contractors who can’t take leadership roles. (Why? Contractors can’t do “inherently governmental functions”. Conflicts of financial interest if a company is put in charge of decisions affecting their own budget.)
  + Strong advocacy by incumbents which runs counter to tech industry practices. (Why? Inertia. Staff who've made personal investments in certifications like ITIL and PMP. Companies not likely to advocate for practices that make the entire industry less lucrative.)
  + Most of all, bureaus don’t have enough personnel on staff with past experience in better software processes who can advocate for it and help implementation.

+ Why don’t bureaus have many staff with experience in better software processes?
  + Default hiring processes are different from industry, focused on certifications and objective measurements, not technical interviews. (Why? A preference for impartiality and the ability to vet candidates with HR generalists.)
  + Developer benefits are less than in the tech sector. (Why? Cost and the optics of lavishing attention on employees.)
  + Developer salaries are less than in the tech sector. (Why? Developers are paid on the same General Schedule as all employees, but tech salaries are often over the upper bound.)
  + No tradition of cross pollination between tech industry and government. (Why? Industries have diverged increasingly over time.)

These problems are institutional, not technical, but it's the progress on these fronts that leads to lasting technical gains after we've left.  Most of them don't derive from laws.  They're issues of perception and understanding.  Those are problems we can absolutely overcome by adapting our experience in the private sector to a new problem space, showing concrete results, and explaining clearly our approach.

I've even seen progress on rules that appeared completely set in stone when I arrived, like the annual budgeting process.  Both the President's budget and the Modernizing Government Technology Act would delegate some authority to working capital funds, so that cost-saving improvements could get funded at a lower level than an Act of Congress.  Members of Congress can and do care about improving government.  But Congress depends on the people of the executive branch, whether short-timers or career civil servants, to understand the problems deeply enough to propose effective solutions.
